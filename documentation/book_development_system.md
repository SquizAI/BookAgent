# Book Development System

## Unified Agentic Framework

The Book Development System operates through a coordinated multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to create comprehensive, pedagogically sound textbook chapters. Each agent has a specific role and expertise, working together through a central orchestration system.

## Agent Communication and State Management

*(Refer to [technical_implementation.md](./technical_implementation.md) for specific implementation details)*

- **Communication:** How agents pass information and tasks (e.g., API calls, message queues).
- **State:** How the overall state of the book development process is tracked and managed (e.g., database, workflow engine).

## Phase 2 Agent Details (Placeholder)

*(This section will be detailed later to specify the roles, inputs, outputs, and interaction patterns for the Editor, Fact-Checker, and Pedagogy agents planned for Phase 2, as per the [BookAgent_Roadmap.md](./BookAgent_Roadmap.md))*.

## Scalability and Future Considerations

- Potential bottlenecks and how to address them.
- Modularity for adding new agent types or capabilities.
- Integration points for external tools or data sources.
