**BookAgent** is an innovative platform designed to empower educators, researchers, and authors to collaboratively create high-quality, pedagogically-sound textbooks and educational materials using advanced AI assistance. It leverages a multi-agent system powered by Google's Gemini models to streamline research, drafting, editing, and validation.

## ‚ú® Vision & Goals

Our vision is to revolutionize educational content creation by:

1.  **Accelerating Development:** Significantly reducing the time and effort required to produce comprehensive learning materials.
2.  **Enhancing Quality:** Integrating pedagogical best practices and fact-checking directly into the writing process.
3.  **Facilitating Collaboration:** Providing a seamless workflow for human authors and AI agents to work together effectively.
4.  **Enabling Personalization:** Laying the groundwork for content that can be adapted to different learning styles and objectives.

## üöÄ Core Features (Planned)

*   **Multi-Agent System:** Specialized AI agents (Director, Research, Writer, Editor, Fact-Checker, Pedagogy) collaborate on content creation tasks.
*   **Gemini-Powered Generation:** Utilizes Google's state-of-the-art Gemini models via Vertex AI for research, drafting, and analysis.
*   **Pedagogical Intelligence:** Agents designed to incorporate effective teaching strategies and learning design principles.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Fact-checking and grounding generated content against reliable sources and user-provided materials.
*   **Collaborative Workflow:** Intuitive UI for users to guide the AI, review drafts, provide feedback, and finalize content.
*   **User Document Integration:** Ability for users to upload their own notes, research, or existing drafts for the AI to reference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **Backend:** NestJS (Node.js), TypeScript
*   **API:** RESTful APIs (initially)
*   **AI:** Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Vertex AI)
*   **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL, Vector Database (TBD for RAG)
*   **Containerization:** Docker

## üß≠ Project Status & Roadmap

BookAgent is currently in the **Phase 1 Planning** stage.

*   **Phase 1:** Foundational Framework & Core Generation (Defining architecture, basic agents, initial UI/UX)
*   **Phase 2:** Enhanced Agents, Validation & Pedagogy (Adding Editor/Fact-Checker/Pedagogy agents, RAG, user uploads)
*   **Phase 3:** Advanced Features & User Experience (Refining UI, advanced pedagogy, integrations)

For detailed planning, see the [Project Roadmap](./documentation/BookAgent_Roadmap.md) and [Technical Implementation](./documentation/technical_implementation.md).
